### COVID-19 Testing Locator

## Location Search

The user can select a U.S. state and view testing site locations and their information. This data is example data; it is not up-to-date. Consequently, some states yield no results.

## Data Visualization

The user can toggle between searching testing locations and viewing data visualization charts for testing accessibility. Currently, the user can select two states and compare testing data as it pertains to accessibility. One chart simply displays the total amount of testing locations recorded for the respective states. Another chart displays a comparison between the states' populations and those states' testing locations per one million residents to highlight what testing accessibility might look like in different states. The calculations performed to compute these values act on the data being retrieved, so updating the recorded data would in turn update these charts. Again, because this data is merely for example, these charts do not reflect any truth in regards to testing accessibility.
